# VanWeather - Vancouver Climate Extremes Dashboard ‚õÖüåßÔ∏èüåû üå®Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è

Welcome to the VanWeather, an interactive tool designed to analyze and visualize weather patterns in Vancouver.
## Purpose 

#### The Problem
Climate conditions in the Vancouver region have undergone significant changes over the years, resulting in shifting climate patterns, increased climate extremes, and notable environmental impacts. However, stakeholders currently lack accessible tools to effectively analyze historical climate data and compare trends over time. This limitation hinders efforts to understand the evolving climate landscape and take necessary actions to address and adapt to the effects of climate change.

#### Solution
VanWeather dashboard addresses the challenge of understanding and adapting to climate change impacts in Vancouver by providing an interactive platform that integrates historical and recent meteorological data. This dashboard allows users to analyze and visualize climate trends and patterns, facilitating informed discussions, policy formulation, and community actions to address and adapt to the evolving climate dynamics at the local level. By empowering stakeholders with accessible insights into Vancouver's changing climate, the VanWeather dashboard supports proactive measures and sustainable decision-making to enhance preparedness for climate-related challenges in the city.
