# VanWeather Proposal

## Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Environmental advocacy group

Target audience: Residents, policymakers, and researchers interested in Vancouver's climate trends

As climate change increasingly impacts Vancouver's weather patterns, understanding and addressing climate extremes becomes crucial for the city's ability to adapt and remain sustainable. However, the lack of accessible, comprehensive tools to analyze and visualize these extremes hampers informed decision-making and proactive measures. Our VanWeather dashboard aims to tackle this challenge by providing an interactive platform that integrates historical and recent meteorological data. This allows users to identify trends and patterns indicative of increasing extremity in Vancouver's climate. By arming users with insights into the city's climate dynamics, the dashboard facilitates informed discussions, policy formulation, and community actions to address and adapt to the impacts of climate change at the local level.


## Description of the data

You are allowed to select any dataset you want for this project,
as long as you have the license to use it publicly.
Finding a suitable data set can take a lot of time and effort.
You are therefore allowed to select one
that you have worked with in a previous lab/project in MDS
if you wish.



## Research questions and usage scenarios


The purpose of this section is to get you to think in more detail about
how your target audience will use the app you're designing
and to account for these detailed needs in the proposal.




## App sketch & brief description

Create a sketch of what you envision your app to look like.
Your sketch can be hand-drawn
or put together using a graphics editor or
slide show software.
The sketch should be saved as `img/sketch.png` and linked in this section of the proposal
so that the image shows up when reading the proposal on GitHub.
