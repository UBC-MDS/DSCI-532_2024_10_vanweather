# VanWeather Proposal

## Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Environmental advocacy group

Target audience: Residents, policymakers, and researchers interested in Vancouver's climate trends

As climate change increasingly impacts Vancouver's weather patterns, understanding and addressing drastic shifts in climate becomes crucial for the city's ability to adapt and remain sustainable. However, the lack of accessible, comprehensive tools to analyze and visualize these substantial changes hampers informed decision-making and proactive measures. Our VanWeather dashboard aims to tackle this challenge by providing an interactive platform that integrates historical and recent meteorological data. This allows users to identify trends and patterns indicative of significant changes in Vancouver's climate. By arming users with insights into the city's climate dynamics, the dashboard facilitates informed discussions, policy formulation, and community actions to address and adapt to the impacts of climate change at the local level.


## Description of the data

You are allowed to select any dataset you want for this project,
as long as you have the license to use it publicly.
Finding a suitable data set can take a lot of time and effort.
You are therefore allowed to select one
that you have worked with in a previous lab/project in MDS
if you wish.



## Research questions and usage scenarios

Dr. Emily Wong is a climate scientist specializing in the impacts of climate change on urban environments. Her focus is on analyzing long-term weather trends to understand how global warming is affecting local climates, particularly in metropolitan areas like Vancouver.
Through our app, Dr. Wong can access a comprehensive dashboard titled "Vancouver Weather Analysis - 50 Year Trends." This tool allows her to systematically examine various weather parameters, including temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and sunlight changes over the last five decades. She starts her investigation by exploring temperature trends, utilizing our app to visualize maximum, minimum, and mean temperature changes, which confirms her suspicion of a gradual increase in local temperatures.
Next, Dr. Wong shifts her focus to precipitation data within our app. She compares historical rainfall and snowfall data, identifying a trend of decreasing snowfall and increasing rainfall, which aligns with her hypotheses about climate change's effects on local weather patterns.
Our app also enables Dr. Wong to analyze wind speed and direction changes over time. She examines these variables to understand their influence on Vancouver's weather dynamics, finding evidence of increasing wind speeds and changes in prevalent wind directions.
Dr. Wong uses our app to study daylight and solar radiation trends. This analysis provides her with additional insights into the broader impacts of climate change, such as shifts in the duration of sunlight that could affect ecosystems and urban life.
Throughout her research, our app proves invaluable, offering Dr. Wong a robust platform for data visualization and analysis. By facilitating easy access to complex datasets and providing comprehensive visualizations, our app empowers her to derive meaningful conclusions and recommendations for urban planning and climate policy. Her findings, supported by the appâ€™s extensive data and analytical capabilities, contribute significantly to the dialogue on urban climate resilience and adaptation strategies.


## App sketch & brief description

Create a sketch of what you envision your app to look like.
Your sketch can be hand-drawn
or put together using a graphics editor or
slide show software.
The sketch should be saved as `img/sketch.png` and linked in this section of the proposal
so that the image shows up when reading the proposal on GitHub.
