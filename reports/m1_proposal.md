# VanWeather Proposal

## Motivation and Purpose

In a few sentences, provide motivation for why you are creating a dashboard:

- Who is your target audience, and what role are you embodying?
- What is the problem the target audience is facing and why is it important to solve?
- How can your dashboard assist in solving this problem for the intended target audience?


## Description of the data

You are allowed to select any dataset you want for this project,
as long as you have the license to use it publicly.
Finding a suitable data set can take a lot of time and effort.
You are therefore allowed to select one
that you have worked with in a previous lab/project in MDS
if you wish.



## Research questions and usage scenarios


The purpose of this section is to get you to think in more detail about
how your target audience will use the app you're designing
and to account for these detailed needs in the proposal.




## App sketch & brief description

Create a sketch of what you envision your app to look like.
Your sketch can be hand-drawn
or put together using a graphics editor or
slide show software.
The sketch should be saved as `img/sketch.png` and linked in this section of the proposal
so that the image shows up when reading the proposal on GitHub.
