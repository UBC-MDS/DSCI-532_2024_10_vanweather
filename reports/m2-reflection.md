## **VanWeather Dashboard Reflection - Milestone 2**

In this milestone, our environmental advocacy group has achieved significant strides in realizing the VanWeather dashboard. Our target audience---residents, policymakers, and researchers---can now explore interactive visualizations of historical and recent meteorological data to discern Vancouver's climate trends.

Reflecting our proposal, the dashboard has materialized several core functionalities. We've integrated a dataset, which covers 50 years of weather data for Vancouver, providing an extensive canvas for analysis. Users can now interact with time-series graphs of maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures, along with precipitation, wind, and solar radiation data. These are filterable by various time aggregations and individual weather variables. Such interactivity was a key objective to aid in informed decision-making regarding climate action.Our proposal envisioned an exhaustive map-based visualization; however, we have temporarily scaled back due to performance constraints. Instead, we opted for simplified, responsive visualizations that prioritize user experience while still offering comprehensive data interaction. This pivot was driven by the necessity for fluid navigation and immediate data representation, which we deemed crucial for user engagement.

A current limitation we're facing is setting up the dashboard to handle comparisons across two different time intervals effectively. It's a feature we're keen to implement correctly, and we're in the process of figuring it out. We aim to have this resolved by next week, making it easier for users to analyze and compare climate data over distinct periods.While we remain committed to the visualization best practices from DSCI 531, we've embraced a richer data representation to deliver a comprehensive narrative of Vancouver's climate trajectory. This approach, albeit more complex, equips users with nuanced insights that simple visualizations might overlook.
