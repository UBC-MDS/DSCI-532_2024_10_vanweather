# **Reflection on Milestone 3 for VanWeather - Vancouver Climate Tracker**

#### Enhancements and Changes Made

For Milestone 3, our efforts were directed towards refining the VanWeather dashboard through functionality and design enhancements. We automated our data pipeline, addressing the limitations of Altair's row cap with Vega-Lite integration for larger datasets. We streamlined our visual representations by removing extraneous elements, like the blue points on our charts, and resized visual elements to negate the need for scrolling. We also evolved our dashboard's interactivity by allowing the average values to dynamically adjust based on user-selected data.

#### Current Dashboard

Our present dashboard (as per the attached image) offers an engaging interface for users to delve into Vancouver's climate data across different timespans. Features such as a comprehensive date range selector, variable aggregations, and assorted environmental metrics update the displayed information in real-time, providing an insightful lens into climatic fluctuations.

#### Feedback Implementation

During this milestone, we tackled various feedback points provided by our instructor, Joel and our lab discussion:

-   **Enhanced Data Handling**: By adopting Vega-Lite, we prepped the dashboard for displaying more extensive datasets. A refresh button added to allow users to obtain latest data via an API. 

-   **Unified Aesthetics**: Aligning the visual elements, we eliminated the blue points for consistency.

-   **Design Fine-Tuning**: Adjustments were made to improve the user interface with better visual spacing and legibility.

-   **Widget Control Clarifications**: All widgets have been updated to match the time periods selected by users. 

-   **Dynamic Text Updates**: We aim to enable text within cards to dynamically reflect the data associated with user-selected time periods for more contextual clarity.

While these enhancements were key, we also noted points for implementation in Milestone 4 due to the condensed timeframe of this week.

#### Known Limitations and Deferrals to Milestone 4

Given the constraints of this milestone's timeframe, we have postponed certain features to Milestone 4:

-    **Further Visual Adjustments**: Additional aesthetic enhancements, such as aligning titles and adding background colors, are on our agenda for further polish.

These deferrals were strategic, ensuring that we prioritize essential functionality and stability in the current phase first before working on refining the minor aesthetics in the next milestone.

#### Reflections and Forward Look

The dashboard currently excels at providing adaptable visual analytics tailored to user preferences. Yet, we acknowledge the recommendation for further aesthetics changes, which we have slated for Milestone 4.

By building upon the foundation we've set and integrating the deferred tasks, we aspire to make VanWeather an indispensable resource for climate pattern analysis in Vancouver. The upcoming milestone will be critical in realizing our vision for a fully responsive and informative dashboard.
