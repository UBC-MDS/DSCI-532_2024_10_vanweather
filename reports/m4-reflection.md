### **Reflection on Dashboard Development (Milestone 4)**

**Incorporated Feedback and Insights:**

We reviewed the peer and instructor reviews this week and made some updates on our dashboard based on them. Particularly useful was the feedback on making the plots clearer and terms less technical. The suggestion to add more descriptions in the README facilitated users\' understanding of the dashboard's functionality and data interpretation.

**Implementation of Proposal Elements:**

Since milestone 3, we have implemented the filtering feature and refined our plots for enhanced clarity. We have also updated the 'Load Data Frame' button with a new font and shape to improve user interaction aesthetics. The dashboard's color scheme was inverted for better readability based on the feedback received, leading to a more aesthetically pleasing green background with white text. The addition of a section for author attribution, as recommended, acknowledges the contributions of each team member.

**Deviations and Implementations:**

In some instances, we deviated from our original proposal due to either implementation complexity or the realization that an alternative approach would be more effective. For instance, we modified certain technical terms like 'apparent temperature' to more user-friendly language to prevent confusion. The decision to remove the date from the x-axis and adjust the size of font in parentheses was taken to declutter the visual space, focusing user attention on the data trends rather than the granular details.

**Known Issues and Best Practices:**

We are aware of a minor issue with the date picker widget alignment which will be resolved in subsequent iterations. While we have generally adhered to the best practices taught in the course, we intentionally kept the toolbars for the Altair/Plotly charts as they provide functionality like chart downloading which might be beneficial for advanced users.

**Dashboard Strengths, Limitations, and Future Improvements:**

Our dashboard stands out in its ability to distill complex climate data into an accessible and engaging format for users. Its interactive design facilitates an intuitive understanding of climate trends, encouraging users to explore and interact with the data in depth.

Future improvements could include the integration of predictive analytics to project future climate trends based on historical data. Additionally, expanding our dataset to include more granular geographic data could offer localized insights, fostering a deeper understanding of regional climate phenomena.

Another aspect we aim to enhance is the mobile responsiveness of the dashboard. Ensuring full functionality on various devices would make our tool even more accessible. User customization features, such as allowing users to set their data ranges and parameters for analysis, could also significantly personalize the user experience.
